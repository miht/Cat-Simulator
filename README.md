# Cat-Simulator
Cat simulator, much like Tamagotchi, written in C# using Unity.

You play by giving the cat a name, and then just sit and watch it walk about and do whatever it feels like. Whenever it's hungry
or needs anything, make sure to fill the food and play with it. Aside from that, there's no more to the game than
pure charm.
